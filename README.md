This blog is meant for capturing my learnings and thoughts and experiences throughout the journey of life.

From time to time, I will try to summarize my readings here so that I do not forget (yes I am very forgetful!!).

Like all grand plans, I also plan to release fiction/non-fiction book summaries in addition to technical stuff.

And if all goes well in the post-COVID world, I hope to travel a lot and share my experiences.
